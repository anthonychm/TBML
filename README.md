# Tensor Basis Machine Learning (TBML)

## Basic Overview
The TBML package is a collection of machine learning frameworks for predicting turbulence variables using scalar invariant basis and basis integrity tensors.

**Figure 1** Example of models in the TBML package. The tensor basis neural network is shown on the left and the turbulent kinetic energy neural network is shown on the right.

## Installation
This package was developed with Python 3.10 and the following libraries:
- numpy 1.22
- torch 1.13
- pandas 1.4
- scikit-learn 1.2
- matplotlib 3.7
- seaborn 0.12

## Frameworks
TBML currently contains four frameworks: tensor basis neural network (TBNN), turbulent kinetic energy neural network (TKENN), zonal neural networks and tensor basis mixture density network (TBmix).

### Tensor Basis Neural Network (TBNN)
As the original TBNN developed by Ling *et al.* (2016) was implemented in Theano, this package offers a modern implementation of TBNN with PyTorch. Users should run TBNN/frontend.py with tbnn_main argument version="v1" to train, validate, and test TBNN.
